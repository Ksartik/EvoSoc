# EvoSoc
Analyzing the development of social networks in an interactive environment through generations
We are trying to simulate the real world in 2d GRAPHICS based on some basic rules and requirments( food , interaction ).


We are expecting some cool results from which we can learn about how the societies would have evolved .... how a ruler  or dictator is formed ... if any .
