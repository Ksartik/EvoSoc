# EvoSoc
Analyzing the development of social networks in an interactive environment through generations
We are trying to simulate the real world in 2d GRAPHICS based on some basic rules and requirments( food , interaction ).

## Motive:
We are expecting some cool results from which we can learn about how the societies would have evolved .... how a leader  is formed ... if any .

## Some of the significant Out Comes..
This a screenshot of our first simulations.
Interestingly we could see two different clusters of being.

### SCRIPT
To run the program through bash script use the following on terminal inside the Java/src directory


```bash
bash simulator.sh
```
## To DOs..
* Update the code to include multithreading to achieve better interaction between members.
* Update Mating Algorithm to achive more realisation.
* Changing the nHumans variable and determine critical population for explosive growth in terms of mating, and other variables
* Adding moving resources representing Animals and Disease resources
* Actually code different sociteties and include enimity between unknown people
